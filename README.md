# PPToPDF
AppleScript that converts PPT to PDF.

The code here is largely based on irmowan's [Convert-ppt-to-pdf](https://github.com/irmowan/Convert-ppt-to-pdf/blob/v1.0/Convert-ppt-to-pdf.applescript). However, his code doesn't work on my computer, so I changed some portions of the code to make this work again. 

I am also a devonthink user. Hence, I created a script that you can drag to your devonthink scripts folder that converts the selected PPTX files into PDFs. 

The PPToPDF includes the function that would do the conversion if you pass in a list of file paths to the function. 

The PPToPDF(DevonThink) file can be directly dragged into the DevonThink scripts file.
